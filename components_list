## üîß Electronics

| Component Name         | Quantity | Description |
|------------------------|----------|-------------|
| **Arduino UNO**        | 1        | Microcontroller board to control the entire system |
| **IR Sensor**          | 2        | Detects the presence of the train on the track |
| **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** | 1 | Measures the distance of the train from the crossing |
| **L293D Motor Driver** | 1        | Controls the direction and motion of the DC motor |
| **DC Motor**           | 1        | Operates the railway gate mechanism |
| **16x2 LCD Display**   | 1        | Displays system status (train detected, gate open/closed) |
| **LED**                | 2        | Visual alert for nearby pedestrians |
| **Buzzer**             | 1        | Audible alert when train is detected |
| **Breadboard**         | 1        | For prototyping the connections |
| **Jumper Wires (Male-to-Male)** | 15+ | For connecting components on the breadboard |
| **Resistors (220Œ© / 1kŒ©)** | As needed | Used with LEDs, sensors, etc. |
| **Power Supply (Battery/USB)** | 1 | Powers the Arduino and motor system |

## üìå Optional / Supporting Components

- **Relay Module** (if you plan to drive larger motors)
- **Push Buttons** (for testing manual trigger)
- **Heat Shrink Tubes / Insulation Tape** (for secure wiring)
- **Mounting Board or Casing** (for final enclosure)

## üìù Notes

- Ensure **correct motor driver wiring** with Arduino and motor.
- Use **appropriate current rating** for the DC motor to avoid overheating the L293D.
- Keep sensor connections **short and stable** to reduce false triggers.
